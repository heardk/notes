> While listening to my favorite podcasts, I’ve noticed a two-word phrase that hosts often use with their guests to cut past the surface-level chitchat and into the heart of a story: “I’m curious.”

> … One regular feature request that we discussed was being able to automatically post your trips on Facebook. It sounds like a simple feature – “I’m taking a trip to Paris! Let me share that with my friends!” But as our team discussed it, we realized how easily this could go wrong. We could see a very short leap to a scenario where our app posted that someone was going to be out of town for the next week, and gave potential thieves the exact dates during which their house would be empty.

We decided the risk wasn’t worth the “fun”.

> Most companies say they’re not competitor obsessed, but still one in five say they look primarily to competitors for product inspiration. Competitive intelligence is useful, but it shouldn’t guide your product strategy.

Product managers have a lot to do, so it makes sense that a majority view their responsibilities as more tactical and less visionary. The downside of that may be shortsightedness when it comes to prioritizing features or driving long-term feature adoption.

 Product teams should rely on senior product leadership—not competitors— to guide vision. CPOs are in demand because they can assess the market, build the strategy, and combat demands from other executive leadership and internal teams about new product features.

Customers care what you build and when you build it, so give them a say, communicate back what you plan to build and when you plan to build it
